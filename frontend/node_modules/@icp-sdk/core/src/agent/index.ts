/**
 * JavaScript and TypeScript module to interact with the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/) for Node.js and browser applications.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { HttpAgent } from '@icp-sdk/core/agent';
 *
 * const agent = await HttpAgent.create({
 *   host: 'https://icp-api.io',
 * });
 *
 * agent.call(..) // Send an update call to the canister
 * agent.query(..) // Send a query call to the canister
 * agent.readState(..) // Read the state of the canister
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using an Agent
 *
 * The agent is a low-level interface that the Actor uses to encode and decode messages to the Internet Computer. It provides `call`, `query` and `readState` methods to the Actor, as well as a few additional utilities. For the most part, calls through the agent are intended to be structured through an Actor, configured with a canister interface that can be automatically generated from a [Candid](https://github.com/dfinity/candid) interface.
 *
 * ### Initializing an Actor
 *
 * The most common use for the agent is to create an actor. This is done by calling the `Actor.createActor` constructor:
 *
 * ```ts
 * Actor.createActor(interfaceFactory: InterfaceFactory, configuration: ActorConfig): ActorSubclass<T>
 * ```
 *
 * The `interfaceFactory` is a function that returns a runtime interface that the Actor uses to strucure calls to a canister. The interfaceFactory can be written manually, but it is recommended to use the `dfx generate` command to generate the interface for your project, or to use the `didc` tool to generate the interface for your project.
 *
 * Actors can also be initialized to include the boundary node http headers, This is done by calling the `Actor.createActor` constructor:
 *
 * ```ts
 * Actor.createActorWithHttpDetails(interfaceFactory: InterfaceFactory, configuration: ActorConfig): ActorSubclass<ActorMethodMappedWithHttpDetails<T>>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Inspecting an actor's agent
 *
 * Use the `Actor.agentOf` method to get the agent of an actor:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const defaultAgent = Actor.agentOf(defaultActor);
 * ```
 *
 * This is useful if you need to replace or invalidate the identity used by an actor's agent.
 *
 * For example, if you want to replace the identity of an actor's agent with a newly authenticated identity from [Internet Identity](https://identity.internetcomputer.org), you can do so by calling the `Actor.replaceAgent` method:
 *
 * ```ts
 * defaultAgent.replaceIdentity(await authClient.getIdentity());
 * ```
 *
 * ### Tips for using fetch
 *
 * The agent uses the browser `fetch` API to make calls to the Internet Computer. If you are not using the agent in the browser, you can pass a custom `fetch` implementation to the agent's constructor. This is useful if you want to use a custom fetch implementation, such as one that adds authentication headers to the request. We recommend using the [isomorphic-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-fetch) package to provide a consistent fetch API across Node.js and the browser. You will also need to provide a `host` option to the agent's constructor, as the agent will not be able to determine the host from the global context.
 *
 * For example,
 *
 * ```ts
 * import fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch';
 * import { HttpAgent } from '@icp-sdk/core/agent';
 *
 * const host = process.env.DFX_NETWORK === 'local' ? 'http://127.0.0.1:4943' : 'https://icp-api.io';
 *
 * const agent = new HttpAgent({ fetch, host });
 * ```
 *
 * You can also pass `fetchOptions` to the agent's constructor, which will be passed to the `fetch` implementation. This is useful if you want to pass additional options to the `fetch` implementation, such as a custom header.
 *
 * For example,
 *
 * ```ts
 * import fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch';
 * import { HttpAgent } from '@icp-sdk/core/agent';
 *
 * const host = process.env.DFX_NETWORK === 'local' ? 'http://127.0.0.1:4943' : 'https://ic0.app';
 *
 * const fetchOptions: RequestInit = {
 *   headers: {
 *     'X-Custom-Header': 'value',
 *   },
 * };
 *
 * const agent = new HttpAgent({ fetch, host, fetchOptions });
 * ```
